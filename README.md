# Blinkenpad

Blinkenlights + Launchpad + Macropad.

Semi-modular system to allow the Launchpad mini MIDI controller to be used as a
macro-pad. This means volume control, keyboard / mouse macros, and DBus / MPRIS
controls.

Right now it does nothing.

## Planned

- [x] Volume control
- [x] Keyboard macros
- [x] MPRIS / Playback control
- [ ] DBUS wiring
- [ ] Mouse macros

## TODO

- [ ] Configuration by TOML (currently hardcoded)
- [x] Volume updates when third party volume controls update
- [ ] Mute for mic and playback
- [ ] Letters support for PadPlugin
